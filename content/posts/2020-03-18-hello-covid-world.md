I don't think we need to be too dramatic. In-fact, I really resisted even mentioning the virus, however it has
led me (and everyone) to an interesting set of circumstances. I have faith that this will pass in
the medium term, however in the short-term; everyone will need to adjust to a new, socially-distant
way of doing the things. 

## Where Are Things At?
As of the time of writing, I have unfortunately found myself out of work. Not to go into too much
detail, but essentially my previous place of employment where forced to downsize to ensure they work their way
back into the black. On top of this; COVID-19 has decided to show up and scare the living be-jeezus out of
everyone across the world (with good reason). So yeah...

Markets are shaky and uncertainty is the only certainty at the moment... so what do?

## Skill Up - Use Your Downtime to Slay It
I found an [article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/coronavirus-academy/) by freeCodeCamp founder [Quincy Larson](https://twitter.com/ossia?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) about
taking advantage of the current set of circumstances. And it really summed it all up to me.

In our modern working life, we were always so busy; there just weren't enough hours in the day. Now?
Now we are sitting it out; spending more time at home, waiting for the tide to subside. No point
squandering this; get out on the net and learn the thing.

### What Are You Doing?
I personally will be aiming to get a `DevOps/Infra/Engineering` position. To do this, I will be focussing on
skilling up with the following strategy:
* Completing a tonne of [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) problems - _better coding_ 
* Smashing out [Linux Academy](https://linuxacademy.com/) courses - _learn new tooling and services_
* Blogging about stuff I learn - _networking and sharing the love_

I think Quincy said it best with this [tweet](https://twitter.com/ossia/status/1239963499167502337):

You can't control the virus or the economy, but you can control your response to it.

Keep calm and soldier on, this too shall pass.
